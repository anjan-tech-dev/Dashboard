Sales & Profitability Analysis in Power BI
This repository contains a showcase of business intelligence dashboards built using Microsoft Power BI. The dashboards provide a multi-faceted view of a company's sales and profitability performance across different markets, products, and time periods.

üìä Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to transform raw sales data into actionable insights. The dashboards are designed for business leaders, sales managers, and analysts to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs), identify trends, and make data-driven decisions. The analysis covers revenue, profit margins, sales volume, and performance against targets.

‚ú® Key Features
Executive KPI Monitoring: High-level cards display critical metrics like Total Revenue, Profit Margin, and Sales Quantity for at-a-glance performance assessment.

Time Series Analysis: Interactive slicers for Year and Month allow users to dynamically filter the data and analyze trends over specific periods. The "Revenue Comparison From Last Year" chart provides a direct look at year-over-year performance.

Geographical Performance Breakdown: Bar charts detail performance metrics such as Profit %, Revenue Contribution %, and Sales Quantity by market (city), making it easy to identify top-performing and underperforming regions.

Customer & Product Analysis: The dashboards include detailed tables and charts to analyze revenue contribution by customer and identify the top-selling products.

Profitability Insights: Dedicated visuals focus on Profit Margin, including a "What-If" parameter to set a Profit Target and see how markets compare against it.

Interactive & User-Friendly: The dashboards are fully interactive, allowing users to cross-filter visuals by clicking on data points (e.g., clicking a market in one chart filters all other visuals for that market).

üñºÔ∏è Dashboard Showcase
Here is a glimpse into the different analytical views provided by the project.

1. Profitability Deep Dive & Customer Analysis
This dashboard focuses on year-over-year revenue and profit margin trends, coupled with a detailed breakdown of profitability by market and customer.

2. High-Level Performance Overview
A summary dashboard that highlights key revenue and profit figures, supported by charts showing market contributions to overall revenue and profit.

3. Sales & Revenue Trend Analysis
This view provides insights into overall revenue trends, sales quantity by market, top products, and a breakdown of customer types (e.g., E-Commerce vs. Brick & Mortar).

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Visualization: Microsoft Power BI

Data Modeling & Calculations: DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)

üìà Key Metrics & Concepts Demonstrated
Revenue & Sales Quantity: Core measures of sales performance.

Profit Margin %: A crucial indicator of profitability, calculated as (Revenue - Cost) / Revenue.

Revenue Contribution %: The share of total revenue generated by a specific market or customer.

Year-over-Year (YoY) Comparison: Comparing current performance (Revenue) with the previous year's performance (Revenue LY).

What-If Parameters: Used for dynamic goal-setting and scenario analysis (e.g., the Profit Target slicer).

Data Visualization Best Practices: Use of appropriate charts (bar, line, donut) and a consistent color scheme to convey information clearly and effectively.
